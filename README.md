## Sentiment-Analysis-in-Python

The Sentiment Analysis has been done on Amazon reviews of some products.
I have used Natural Language Processing to analyse the sentiments i.e. the python NLTK library.
The project has been implemented using the techniques below:-

1. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - Bag of words approach
2. Roberta Pretrained Model from ðŸ¤—
